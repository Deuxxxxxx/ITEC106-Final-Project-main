              <h3 id="1">PHP as Server-Side Scripting Language</h3>
              <p>
                The term PHP is an acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. It is open-source which means it is free to download and use. It is very simple to learn and use. The files have the extension “.php”.
                <br />
                <br />
                Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) is an open-source, free server-side scripting language widely used in web development. According to Web Technology Surveys, PHP is used by 78.1% of all websites, including high-traffic websites like Facebook and Wikipedia. 
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Server-Side Scripting</strong>
                  <p>A script is a series of instructions to be executed on other programs or applications. There are two types of scripting languages – ones intended for the server-side or the back-end and ones for the client-side or front-end. <br>

                  PHP is a server-side scripting language, which means that a server executes the instructions in a script. Then, the server provides data on request, channels the requests, and organizes the information in a database.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Difference between Server Side Scripting and Client Side Scripting</strong>
                  <p> <strong>1. Client-Side Scripting: </strong> Web browsers execute client-side scripting. It is used when browsers have all code. Source code is used to transfer from webserver to user’s computer over the internet and run directly on browsers. It is also used for validations and functionality for user events. <br> <br>

                  It allows for more interactivity. It usually performs several actions without going to the user. It cannot be basically used to connect to databases on a web server. These scripts cannot access the file system that resides in the web browser. Pages are altered on basis of the user’s choice. It can also be used to create “cookies” that store data on the user’s computer. </p>
                </li>
                  <p> <strong>2. Server-side scripting : </strong> Web servers are used to execute server-side scripting. They are basically used to create dynamic pages. It can also access the file system residing at the webserver. A server-side environment that runs on a scripting language is a web server. <br> <br>

                    Scripts can be written in any of a number of server-side scripting languages available. It is used to retrieve and generate content for dynamic pages. It is used to require to download plugins. In this load times are generally faster than client-side scripting. When you need to store and retrieve information a database will be used to contain data. It can use huge resources of the server. It reduces client-side computation overhead. The server sends pages to the request of the user/client. </p>
                </li>

                Basics of MySQL as Database Management System
              </h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>MySQL is a Database Management System</strong>
                  <p>A database is a structured collection of data. It may be anything from a simple shopping list to a picture gallery or the vast amounts of information in a corporate network. To add, access, and process data stored in a computer database, you need a database management system such as MySQL Server. Since computers are very good at handling large amounts of data, database management systems play a central role in computing, as standalone utilities, or as parts of other applications.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>MySQL Databases are Relational</strong>
                  <p>A relational database stores data in separate tables rather than putting all the data in one big storeroom. The database structures are organized into physical files optimized for speed. The logical model, with objects such as databases, tables, views, rows, and columns, offers a flexible programming environment. You set up rules governing the relationships between different data fields, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, unique, required or optional, and “pointers” between different tables. The database enforces these rules, so that with a well-designed database, your application never sees inconsistent, duplicate, orphan, out-of-date, or missing data.</p>
                  <p>The SQL part of “MySQL” stands for “Structured Query Language”. SQL is the most common standardized language used to access databases. Depending on your programming environment, you might enter SQL directly (for example, to generate reports), embed SQL statements into code written in another language, or use a language-specific API that hides the SQL syntax.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>MySQL software is Open Source</strong>
                  <p>Open Source means that it is possible for anyone to use and modify the software. Anybody can download the MySQL software from the Internet and use it without paying anything. If you wish, you may study the source code and change it to suit your needs. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The MySQL Database Server is very fast, reliable, scalable, and easy to use</strong>
                  <p>If that is what you are looking for, you should give it a try. MySQL Server can run comfortably on a desktop or laptop, alongside your other applications, web servers, and so on, requiring little or no attention. If you dedicate an entire machine to MySQL, you can adjust the settings to take advantage of all the memory, CPU power, and I/O capacity available. MySQL can also scale up to clusters of machines, networked together.</p>

                  <p>MySQL Server was originally developed to handle large databases much faster than existing solutions and has been successfully used in highly demanding production environments for several years. Although under constant development, MySQL Server today offers a rich and useful set of functions. Its connectivity, speed, and security make MySQL Server highly suited for accessing databases on the Internet.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>MySQL Server works in client/server or embedded systems</strong>
                  <p>The MySQL Database Software is a client/server system that consists of a multithreaded SQL server that supports different back ends, several different client programs and libraries, administrative tools, and a wide range of application programming interfaces (APIs).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>A large amount of contributed MySQL software is available</strong>
                  <p>MySQL Server has a practical set of features developed in close cooperation with our users. It is very likely that your favorite application or language supports the MySQL Database Server.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 id="3">The Roles of PHP and MySQL in Building Dynamic Websites</h3>
              <p>
                PHP is a server-side scripting language embedded in HTML in its simplest form. PHP allows web developers to create dynamic content and interact with databases. PHP is known for its simplicity, speed, and flexibility — features that have made it a cornerstone in the web development world.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>A Scripting Language:</strong>
                  <p>Scripting languages are interpreted by another program at runtime (no need for compilation). Scripting languages can be interpreted server-side or client-side (in the browser). </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Server-Side: </strong>
                  <p>PHP is a server-side scripting language processed by a PHP interpreter on a web server; the result (the output) is sent to the web browser as plain HTML.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Open-Source: </strong>
                  <p>PHP is freely available to download and use.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Object-Oriented: </strong>
                  <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) leverages the concept of “objects” to contain data and functions to help build more complex, reusable web applications. OOP was added to PHP5.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Fast: </strong>
                  <p>PHP uses its memory, minimizing server workload and increasing performance. PHP can be up to 382% faster than Python and 195% faster than Ruby.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Simple: </strong>
                  <p>The PHP syntax is easily understood and learned, whether you’re building from scratch or leveraging existing frameworks or add-ons.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Well Supported: </strong>
                  <p>PHP supports all leading databases (MySQL, SQLite, ODBC) and is compatible with most servers (Apache, IIS, etc.). It is portable across all platforms (Windows, Mac OS, Linux, etc., and can be further supported by PHP frameworks (Laravel, CodeIgniter, Symfony) and many well-stocked and vetted libraries.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <strong>Dynamic Website with PHP and MySQL</strong>
              <p>Most people or companies use their Dynamic website with PHP and MySQL because they both are open source means one needs to spend nothing to access them. It, another important benefit of using a Dynamic website with PHP and MySQL is it provides an interactive, user-friendly website that also facilitates visitors to openly interact while producing dynamic and flexible content.</p>
              <strong>Data Security</strong>
              <p>We all know the importance of data in the modern world, thus it is important to secure it, and it is not wrong to say that MySQL is one the most secure and reliable database management systems. Many popular Dynamic websites like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Facebook, and Twitter use MySQL.</p>
