                Laravel and Django
              </h3>
              <strong>Laravel</strong>
              <p>Laravel is an open-source PHP framework, which is robust and easy to understand. It follows a model-view-controller design pattern. Laravel reuses the existing components of different frameworks which helps in creating a web application. The web application thus designed is more structured and pragmatic. <br> <br>

              Laravel offers a rich set of functionalities which incorporates the basic features of PHP frameworks like CodeIgniter, Yii and other programming languages like Ruby on Rails. Laravel has a very rich set of features which will boost the speed of web development.</p>

                <li>
                  <strong>Routing</strong>
                  <p>Laravel provides a flexible approach to the user to define routes in the web application. Routing helps to scale the application in a better way and increases its performance.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Configuration Management</strong>
                <p>A web application designed in Laravel will be running on different environments, which means that there will be a constant change in its configuration. Laravel provides a consistent approach to handle the configuration in an efficient way.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Query Builder and ORM</strong>
                  <p>Laravel incorporates a query builder which helps in querying databases using various simple chain methods. It provides ORM (Object Relational Mapper) and ActiveRecord implementation called Eloquent.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Schema Builder</strong>
                  <p>Schema Builder maintains the database definitions and schema in PHP code. It also maintains a track of changes with respect to database migrations.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Template Engine</strong>
                  <p>Laravel uses the Blade Template engine, a lightweight template language used to design hierarchical blocks and layouts with predefined blocks that include dynamic content.</p>

                </li>
                <li><strong>Redis</strong>
                  <p>Laravel uses Redis to connect to an existing session and general-purpose cache. Redis interacts with session directly.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Queues</strong>
                  <p>Laravel includes queue services like emailing large number of users or a specified Cron job. These queues help in completing tasks in an easier manner without waiting for the previous task to be completed.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Event and Command Bus</strong>
                  <p>Laravel 5.1 includes Command Bus which helps in executing commands and dispatch events in a simple way. The commands in Laravel act as per the application’s lifecycle.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <!-- Django  -->
              <strong>Django</strong>
              <p>Django is a web development framework that assists in building and maintaining quality web applications. Django helps eliminate repetitive tasks making the development process an easy and time saving experience. <br> <br>
              
              Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django makes it easier to build better web apps quickly and with less code.</p>

                Using a Web Framework for Web Development
              </h3>
              <p>Here are the benefits of using web framework for web development</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Makes easier the Development Process</strong>
                  <p>The frameworks provide the tools and packages to help people start developing their websites.
                  Thanks to the frameworks, the software does not have to write all the scripts from scratch, as the framework handles many standard templates developed from scratch. They also offer beginners opportunities to explore important areas and offer people a wide range of tools and experts.
                  Frames significantly reduce coding time because they launch the basic structure and store network programs in the form of a ship.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Eases Debugging and Application Maintenance</strong>
                  <p>Many programming languages do not place much emphasis on the readability and robustness of code during flight.
                  Frames do that; although developing a framework-adapted online program is highly recommended, it has a lot to do with ease of debugging and maintenance.
                  Because there is a community of developments associated with each framework, there is always an immediate response to any problems that arise with the foundation. In addition, many models allow developers to run their first tests.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reduces Code Length</strong>
                  <p>There is no need to write long lines of rules with frames but add common patterns on the website.
                  Therefore introduce quickly and clearly in the code section. This reduction in additional time and effort is often associated with overall performance development.
                  In addition, the frameworks provide features and tools that allow developers to go about automating everyday tasks such as Internet development, text storage, session management authentication, and URL mapping.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Improves Database Proficiency</strong>
                  <p>Many frameworks start with a set of rules that allow programs to work with related data repeatedly.
                  Although some standards facilitate data integration, they include an under-radar Object Relational Mapping (ORM) engine. Other examples use this ORM object to write directly to programming languages.
                  Moreover, developers can use this ORM model to perform database functions without writing long SQL codes.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reinforces security</strong>
                  <p>Developers do not need snapshots to protect the security of their online programs, such as SQL injection, web application fraud, and database manipulation.
                  The built-in security features and methods provide developers with a more common way to protect a website from current and future security threats.
                  Developers can also use features and tools as their basic capabilities to rely on special protection for their websites.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
