              <h3 id="1">PHP Syntax</h3>
              <p>
                The structure which defines PHP computer language is called PHP
                syntax. <br />
                <br />

                The PHP script is executed on the server and the HTML result is
                sent to the browser. It can normally have HTML and PHP tags. PHP
                or Hypertext Preprocessor is a widely used open-source
                general-purpose scripting language and can be embedded with
                HTML. PHP files are saved with the “.php” extension. PHP scripts
                can be written anywhere in the document within PHP tags along
                with normal HTML.
              </p>
              <strong>Syntax</strong> <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                <strong>Canonical PHP Tags:</strong> The script starts with
                <?php and ends with ?>. These tags are also called ‘Canonical
                PHP tags’. Everything outside of a pair of opening and closing
                tags is ignored by the PHP parser. The open and closing tags are
                called delimiters. Every PHP command ends with a semi-colon (;).
                Let’s look at the hello world program in PHP.
              </p>
              <strong>Example</strong> <br />
              <code>
                # Here echo command is used to print <br />
                echo "Hello, world!"; <br />
              </code>
              <br />
              <strong>Output:</strong>
              <p>Hello, world!</p>
              <strong>Constant: </strong>
              <p>
                Constants can be defined using the const keyword or define()
                function. <br />

                There is some difference between constants and variables.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Constants do not have $ in front of them like variables have.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Constants can be accessed from anywhere without regard to
                  variable scoping rules.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <strong>Comments in PHP:</strong>
              <p>
                Comments help in reminding the developer about the code if it’s
                re-visited after a period of time. <br />
                <br />

                A comment is something that is ignored and not read or executed
                by the PHP engine or the language as part of a program and is
                written to make the code more readable and understandable. These
                are used to help other users and developers to describe the code
                and what it is trying to do. It can also be used in documenting
                a set of codes or parts of a program. You must have noticed this
                in the above sample programs. PHP supports two types of comment:
              </p>
              <strong>Single Line Comment:</strong> <br />
              As the name suggests these are single line or short relevant
              explanations that one can add to their code. To add this, we need
              to begin the line with (//) or (#). <br /><br />
              <strong>Example</strong> <br />
              <code>
                // This is a single line comment <br />
                // These cannot be extended to more lines <br />

                echo "hello world!!!"; <br />

                # This is also a single line comment
              </code>
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Output: </strong> <br />
              <p>hello world!!!</p>
              <strong>Multi-line or Multiple line Comment: </strong>
              <p>
                These are used to accommodate multiple lines with a single tag
                and can be extended to many lines as required by the user. To
                add this, we need to begin and end the line with (/*…*/)
              </p>
              <strong>Example</strong> <br />
              <code>
                /* This is a multi line comment <br />
                In PHP variables are written <br />
                by adding a $ sign at the beginning.*/ <br />

                $geek = "hello world!"; <br />
                echo $geek;
              </code>
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Output: </strong> <br />
              <p>hello world!</p>
              <strong>Case Sensitivity in PHP: </strong> <br />
              <p>
                <strong>PHP is insensitive to whitespace.</strong> PHP is
                insensitive to whitespace. This includes all types of spaces
                that are invisible on the screen including tabs, spaces, and
                carriage returns. Even one space is equal to any number of
                spaces or carriage returns. This means that PHP will ignore all
                the spaces or tabs in a single row or carriage return in
                multiple rows. Unless a semi-colon is encountered, PHP treats
                multiple lines as a single command.
              </p>
              <strong>Example: </strong> <br />
              <code>
                // PHP code illustrate the whitespace insensitivity <br />
                $var1 = 15; <br />
                $var2 = <br />
                30; <br />
                $sum = $var1 <br />
                + <br />
                $var2; <br />

                // "\n" for new line <br />
                echo $sum, "\n"; <br />

                $sum1 = $var1 + $var2; <br />
                echo $sum1; <br />
              </code>
              <strong>Output: </strong>
              <p>
                45 <br />
                45
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>Both of them show the same results without any errors.</i>
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>PHP is case-sensitive.</strong> All the keywords,
                functions, and class names in PHP (while, if, echo, else, etc)
                are NOT case-sensitive except variables. Only variables with
                different cases are treated differently. Let’s look at this
                example:
              </p>
              <strong>Example: </strong> <br />
              <code>
                // Here we can see that all echo <br />
                // statements are executed in the same manner <br />

                $variable = 25; <br />
                echo $variable; <br />
                ECHO $variable; <br />
                EcHo $variable; <br />

                // but this line will show RUNTIME ERROR as <br />
                // "Undefined Variable" <br />
                echo $VARIABLE <br />
              </code>
              <strong>Output: </strong>
              <p>
                25 <br />
                25 <br />
                25 <br />
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Blocks in PHP: </strong>In PHP, multiple statements can
                be executed simultaneously (under a single condition or loop) by
                using curly-braces ({}). This forms a block of statements that
                gets executed simultaneously.
              </p>
              <strong>Example: </strong> <br />
              <code>
                $var = 50; <br />
                if ($var>0){ <br />
                echo ("Positive as \n"); <br />
                echo ("greater than 0"); <br />
                } <br />
              </code>
              <strong>Output: </strong>
              <p>
                Positive as <br />
                greater than 0
              </p>
              <strong>PHP Data Types</strong>
              <p>
                Data Types define the type of data a variable can store. PHP
                allows eight different types of data types. All of them are
                discussed below. There are pre-defined, user-defined, and
                special data types.
              </p>
              <strong>1. Integer:</strong>
              <p>
                Integers hold only whole numbers including positive and negative
                numbers, i.e., numbers without fractional part or decimal point.
                They can be decimal (base 10), octal (base 8), or hexadecimal
                (base 16). The default base is decimal (base 10). The octal
                integers can be declared with leading 0 and the hexadecimal can
                be declared with leading 0x. The range of integers must lie
                between -2^31 to 2^31.
              </p>
              <strong>Example: </strong> <br />
              <code>
                // decimal base integers <br />
                $deci1 = 50; <br />
                $deci2 = 654; <br />

                // octal base integers <br />
                $octal1 = 07; <br />

                // hexadecimal base integers <br />
                $octal = 0x45; <br />

                $sum = $deci1 + $deci2; <br />
                echo $sum; <br />
                echo "\n\n"; <br />

                //returns data type and value <br />
                var_dump($sum) <br />
              </code>
              <strong>Output: </strong>
              <p>
                704 <br />

                int(704)
              </p>
              <strong>2. Double:</strong>
              <p>
                Can hold numbers containing fractional or decimal parts
                including positive and negative numbers or a number in
                exponential form. By default, the variables add a minimum number
                of decimal places. The Double data type is the same as a float
                as floating-point numbers or real numbers.
              </p>
              <strong>Example: </strong> <br />
              <code>
                $val1 = 50.85; <br />
                $val2 = 654.26; <br />

                $sum = $val1 + $val2; <br />

                echo $sum; <br />
                echo "\n\n"; <br />

                //returns data type and value <br />
                var_dump($sum) <br />
              </code>
              <strong>Output: </strong>
              <p>
                705.11 <br />

                float(705.11)
              </p>
              <strong>3. String:</strong>
              <p>
                Hold letters or any alphabets, even numbers are included. These
                are written within double quotes during declaration. The strings
                can also be written within single quotes, but they will be
                treated differently while printing variables. To clarify this
                look at the example below.
              </p>
              <strong>Example: </strong> <br />
              <code>
                $name = "Krishna"; <br />
                echo "The name of the Geek is $name \n"; <br />
                echo 'The name of the geek is $name '; <br />
                echo "\n\n";<br />

                //returns data type, size and value<br />
                var_dump($name)<br />
              </code>
              <strong>Output: </strong>
              <p>
                The name of the Geek is Krishna <br />
                The name of the geek is $name <br />

                string(7) "Krishna" <br />
              </p>
              <strong>4. Boolean: </strong>
              <p>
                Boolean data types are used in conditional testing. Hold only
                two values, either TRUE(1) or FALSE(0). Successful events will
                return true and unsuccessful events return false. NULL type
                values are also treated as false in Boolean. Apart from NULL, 0
                is also considered false in boolean. If a string is empty then
                it is also considered false in boolean data type.
              </p>
              <strong>Example: </strong> <br />
              <code>
                if(TRUE) <br />
                echo "This condition is TRUE"; <br />
                if(FALSE) <br />
                echo "This condition is not TRUE"; <br />
              </code>
              <strong>Output: </strong>
              <p>This condition is TRUE</p>
              <strong>5. Array:</strong>
              <p>
                Array is a compound data type that can store multiple values of
                the same data type. Below is an example of an array of integers.
                It combines a series of data that are related together.
              </p>
              <strong>Example: </strong> <br />
              <code>
                $intArray = array( 10, 20 , 30); <br />

                echo "First Element: $intArray[0]\n"; <br />
                echo "Second Element: $intArray[1]\n"; <br />
                echo "Third Element: $intArray[2]\n\n"; <br />

                //returns data type and value <br />
                var_dump($intArray); <br />
              </code>
              <strong>Output: </strong>
              <p>
                First Element: 10 <br />
                Second Element: 20 <br />
                Third Element: 30 <br />

                array(3) { <br />
                [0]=> <br />
                int(10) <br />
                [1]=> <br />
                int(20) <br />
                [2]=> <br />
                int(30) <br />
                }
              </p>
              <strong>6. Objects:</strong>
              <p>
                Objects are defined as instances of user-defined classes that
                can hold both values and functions and information for data
                processing specific to the class. This is an advanced topic and
                will be discussed in detail in further articles. When the
                objects are created, they inherit all the properties and
                behaviours from the class, having different values for all the
                properties.
              </p>
              <strong>Example: </strong>
              <code>
                class gfg { <br />
                var $message; <br />

                function gfg($message) { <br />
                $this->message = $message; <br />
                } <br />

                function msg() { <br />
                return "This is an example of " . $this->message . "!"; <br />
                } <br />
                } <br />

                // instantiating a object <br />
                $newObj = new gfg("Object Data Type");<br />
                echo $newObj -> msg();<br />
              </code>
              <strong>Output: </strong>
              <p>This is an example of Object Data Type!</p>
              <strong>7. NULL:</strong>
              <p>
                These are special types of variables that can hold only one
                value i.e., NULL. We follow the convention of writing it in
                capital form, but it’s case-sensitive. If a variable is created
                without a value or no value, it is automatically assigned a
                value of NULL. It is written in capital letters.
              </p>
              <strong>Example: </strong> <br />
              <code>
                $nm = NULL; <br />
                echo $nm; // this will return no output <br />

                // return data type <br />
                var_dump($nm); <br />
              </code>
              <strong>Output: </strong>
              <p>NULL</p>
              <strong>8. Resources:</strong>
              <p>
                Resources in PHP are not an exact data type. These are basically
                used to store references to some function call or to external
                PHP resources. For example, consider a database call. This is an
                external resource. Resource variables hold special handles for
                files and database connections.
