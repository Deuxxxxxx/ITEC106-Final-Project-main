              <h3 id="1">Introduction to Web Development</h3>
              <p>
                Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites.
                <p>The word Web Development is made up of two words, that is:

                  <p><strong>Web:</strong> It refers to websites, web pages or anything that works over the internet.</p>
                  <p><strong>Development:</strong> It refers to building the application from scratch.</p> 
                </p>
                
              </p>

              <!-- 2nd Section -->
              <h3 id="2">Importance of Web Development</h3>
              <p>
                So with all the digital and social advancements, why is web development still important:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Maintaining Ownership</strong>
                  <p>
                    It is critical to protect your brand identity by owning your web address and website. This will avoid surrendering control of your brand to a third party website and their ads. Remember, owning your own domain name and using a reputable host company is just as important as choosing the domain name itself. Owning your domain name is vital to your business, brand and online presence. Not only does it build your brand, it also makes people more likely to engage with your website.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Control Your Content With Good Web Development</strong>
                  <p>
                    How you present your content is just as important. Make sure content is original, relevant and interesting to effectively get your message across. With good web development, you control the user experience, manage content relevancy and your conversion process.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Create a Content Hub</strong>
                  <p>
                    It is no secret that blogs are fundamental to your digital marketing strategy and should be the focal point for all your content marketing activities. Use your social media presence as a means to engage your audience and ultimately bring visitors to your website.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Attracting Search Traffic</strong>
                  <p>
                    Good web development means a fully optimised website which plays a vital role in attracting valuable search engine traffic. Consumers are essentially still looking for information by using keyword searches in Google and other search engines. Implementing the right keywords and topics on your website will significantly help visitors find your site.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Monitor, Tweak and Improve</strong>
                  <p>
                    Effective web development gives you the ability to accurately analyse website statistics. It includes measuring conversion rates, monitoring backlinks and assessing visitor engagement, all of which are essential to improve all your online marketing activities. The goal is to ultimately achieve a return on your web investment and integrating Google Analytics, Google Webmaster tools and a CMS will certainly help.
                  </p>

                Hypertext Markup Language
              </h3>
              <p>
                HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. 
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Elements and Tags</strong>
                  <p>
                    HTML uses predefined tags and elements which tell the browser how to properly display the content. Remember to include closing tags. If omitted, the browser applies the effect of the opening tag until the end of the page.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>HTML page structure</strong>
                  <p>
                   It contains the essential building-block elements (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <!-- Common information security threats -->
              <h3 id="4">Cascading Style Sheets</h3>
              <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.</p>

              <!-- Technologies used for information security -->
              <h3 id="5">JavaScript</h3>
              <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language which is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript is a weakly typed language(dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Client-side:</strong>
                  <p>
                    It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS, and so many others.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Server-side:</strong>
                  <p>
                    It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Imperative language</strong>
                  <p>
                    In this type of language we are mostly concerned about how it is to be done. It simply controls the flow of computation. The procedural programming approach, object, oriented approach comes under this as async await we are thinking about what is to be done further after the async call.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Declarative programming</strong>
                  <p>
                    In this type of language we are concerned about how it is to be done, basically here logical computation requires. Her main goal is to describe the desired result without direct dictation on how to get it as the arrow function does.
                  </p>
                </li>

              <h3 id="6">What are Interactive and Dynamic Website?</h3>
              <h4>Interactive Website</h4>
              <p>An interactive web design is a design for websites which uses other inbuilt software, modules or features aimed at creating an environment for a website or web application user to be actively engaged during visit or use as the case may be, thereby improving his or her user experience (UX).</p>
              <p>
                The method of designing a website with an interactive exchange is known as interactive web marketing. It enables the designer to develop a better experience for users and usability. An interactive site’s primary goal is to provide users with entertaining, interactive, and relevant material. Not only will a dynamic professional website offer appealing material, but it will also showcase interactive elements.
              </p>
              <h4>Dynamic Website</h4>
              <p>A dynamic website is a website that displays different types of content every time a user views it. This display changes depending on a number of factors like viewer demographics, time of day, location, language settings, and so on.</p>
              <strong>Types of Dynamic Website</strong>
              <p>
                While static pages require manual updating before their contents change, dynamic websites offer unique content to visitors each time they view the site. This is done through a combination of client-side and server-side scripting. Client-side scripting uses a web browser to process the code, while server-side scripting employs scripts to operate on the originating server.
              </p>
              <ul>
                
                <li><strong>Client-side scripting</strong>
                  <p>Uses scripting languages like JavaScript that render changes to the webpage according to user actions like mouse clicks or keyboard strokes.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Server-side scripting</strong>
                  <p>Sends code before the content lands on the user’s end, personalizing aspects like login pages or submission forms.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
